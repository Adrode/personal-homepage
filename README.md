## Technologies Used

- **React**: 
  - A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This project utilizes several key elements of React:
    - **Functional Components**: The application is built using functional components, which provide a simpler and more readable structure compared to class components.
    - **Hooks**: React Hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, are used to manage state and side effects within components, enhancing functionality and reactivity. 
    - **Redux**: Redux is integrated for state management, allowing for:
      - **Centralized State Management**: All application state is stored in a single store, making it easier to debug and track changes.
      - **Predictable State Updates**: State changes are handled through actions and reducers, ensuring a predictable flow of data.

- **CSS with Styled Components**: 
  - The styling for the application is achieved using Styled Components, a popular CSS-in-JS library. This approach allows for:
    - **Scoped Styles**: Each component can have its own styles that are scoped to that component, preventing style conflicts and making the code more maintainable.
    - **Dynamic Styling**: Styled Components enable the use of props to dynamically adjust styles based on component state or props, allowing for more interactive and responsive design.

- **HTML**: 
  - HTML provides the structure for the webpage, enabling semantic markup that improves accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The homepage is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Clean Layout**: A modern and intuitive layout allows users to easily navigate through the different sections showcasing skills and projects.
- **Contact Information**: Users can find contact details and links to social media, facilitating easy communication.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
